## About This Project This repository serves as a technical knowledge base for Security Operations and Engineering. It consolidates lab work and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for:

Forensic Analysis: extracting and analyzing volatile and non-volatile data.

Reverse Engineering: Using debuggers and disassemblers to understand closed-source executables.

Secure Development: Integrating SAST/DAST tools and security gates into software development.
